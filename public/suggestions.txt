1. The voting feature for the products is great. But when the number of up-votes and down-votes are equal the #of votes
is showing zero. We believe it would be better if there was something like #of up-votes and #of down-votes for products.

2. It would be better to add more information to user profile such as name and contact details like cell number, so the
other users will be able to contact the seller promptly.

Suggestions to Web10:
1. Regarding the posts, they seem to be in chronological order which is fine as of now. But as the volume of posts grow,
 the problem will be to find the latest post. So we believe it is a better option to list the posts in reverse
 chronological order. Also adding paginate will be a good idea

2. The application is working fine, however the look and feel of the app can be improved by adding some styling. :-)
